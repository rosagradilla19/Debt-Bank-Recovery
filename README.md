# Which Debts should the Bank try to recover?

For this project I looked at debts legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank. 
In these situations the bank still tries to collect as much as possible, it assigns each customer a recovery strategy based on the expected amount
the bank believes it will recover from the customer.

The goal was to determine whether the incremental amount the bank earns exceeds the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery stategy.
Regression discontinuity is an analysis methos useful in any situation of a threshold assignment.
